# The Core template
Core is a classless website template. A no-style, no-frills template â€“ just clean markup, ready for your design.

The Core template is more like a blank canvas than a finished painting. It does not define special classes you must add to your HTML elements. The template were built to let you apply your own design system, or layer frameworks on top. You can style any page just by linking to the style sheet of your choice.
